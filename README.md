# War Card Game

## 1) Initial Setup
- **Deck**: A standard 52-card deck is shuffled and evenly divided between the player and the computer (26 cards each, face down).
- **Card Rankings** (from highest to lowest):
  1. Ace (Highest)
  2. King
  3. Queen
  4. Jack
  5. 10
  6. 9
  7. 8
  8. 7
  9. 6
  10. 5
  11. 4
  12. 3
  13. 2 (Lowest)

## 2) How the Game Works
- **Rounds**:
  - Both the player and the computer place one card face-up from their respective decks.
  - The player with the higher-ranked card wins the round and takes both cards.
  
- **War** (if cards tie in rank):
  - If both cards are of the same rank, a "War" occurs:
    1. Both players place three cards face-down in the center.
    2. Then, they place one more card face-up.
    3. The player with the higher face-up card wins all the cards in the war.
    4. If the face-up cards are still of the same rank, the war continues until one player wins.

## 3) Game End
- The game ends when one player has no cards left.
